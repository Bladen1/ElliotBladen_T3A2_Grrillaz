1) The Problem

The NFT market is exploding. innovation and ingenuiety is at extreme levels. Now is a great opportunity to not only cash in, but to start to test and develope innovate business ideas through NFT style models.

The old way is dead, the new way is in. Western Culture has come full circle. The NFT craze is here to stay. NFT's are not just art. They are actually models for ornaising people. Whether that be through business of friendships, the new web is  structureing communities like we have never seen before. 

In this project my team and I attend to produce 3333 collectabile piece's of art and intend to turn this into a digat represeantation of value. Think of it like stock in a company. This new company however is organised and and represented through a DAO. These DAO's are run  
on the internet and give memeber exclusive access and voting rights on how the community is driven

2) About

Infantz is the first in a series of art collections created by Grrillaz and is comprised of 3333 pieces. Owners of Infantz gain exclusive free access to future Grrillaz art collections and token airdrops, along with voting rights within the DAO. Our mission is to create art pieces that are underpinned by our Grrillaz token that provides holders with real world utility. Grrillaz ss dedicated in creating value for its holders. 



3) Road Map

Stage 1

Series I

3333 Mint at 0.5 SOL. The DAO treasury will be granted 133 Infantz for future prizes/giveaways/collaborations or best use, as voted by holders. DAO treasury will receive 75% of all secondary sales revenue. 

Listing Infantz on secondary marketplaces. 


Stage 2

Establishment of GrrillazNFT token. 1,000,000,000 supply. 

Establishment of collaborations and partnerships within the SOL and ETH communities. 

A snapshot will be taken of holders within the first 1 month. Those who minted an Infantz and still possess the art piece, will receive a Grrillaz series II collection piece, 'Evolutions'. 

Holders who stake an Evolutions art piece by GrrillazNFT will receive the following benefits: 

	- Weekly airdrops of GrillazNFT token
	- Access to the Evolutions holders channel
    - Exclusive voting rights on how to invest the treasury money if Crypto Projects

   
This is the peoples Treasures. Votes of Investments such as cryptocurriencies and NFT projects will be put to vote. 

Listing Infantz on secondary marketplaces.  

Listing of Evolutions on secondary marketplaces.

Stage 3

Establishment of DEX liquidity pool for GrillazNFT token / USDC. 

GrillazNFT token available via staking of an Evolutions art piece or via purchasing on DEX.

Option 1

Development of Online Casino and Sportsbet, utilising the GrrillazNFT token. Weekly revenue profits (100%) will be used to buy back and burn GrillazNFT from current circulation.

Option 2

The set up of an Investment club. Investing all DAO profits back into the NFT community. All Assets will then be underpinned by our 

Further community partnership to expand the GrillazNFT token utility

Stage 4

Tokenomics

TBA


5) Target Audience

Age/Demographics

13-40 Males

The NFT generation is for Millinieals and under. Studying the demographics of the NFT crowd, amles dominate with particiapation of upto 90%. Therefore our project will aimed to towards males under the age of 40. The art complements this. As well as project name, sturcture and design. The road map is finianailised whcih gemphaisis greater male particiaption. This is not to saty females can't join. There are welcomed. Considering the art is cutesy I have no doubt in my mind that females will particiapte in the mint



TechStack

Ruby on Rails
    - Ruby will provide the programmel language while rails will put it all together
Gem's
    - Webpacker: To run 

    - React: To run the front end of the website

The mint will done entirely differently. It will be done on the Solana network, which is serpate altogether. For the stack it will be Solana, Rust as the programming languae and react as the front end. The full stack application I will use will be Metaplex. The minting software I will using will be called Candy Machine. Please look out for it as it will be my next Git upload
